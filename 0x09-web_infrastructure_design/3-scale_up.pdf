1. **Web Servers (Nginx):**
   - Role: Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static and dynamic content.
   - **Why**: Separating web serving from application logic for scalability and maintainability. Distributing the load improves performance.

2. **Application Servers:**
   - Role: Executes application logic, processes dynamic content.
   - **Why**: Isolating application processing for easier scaling and maintenance. Allows independent scaling of web and app tiers.

3. **Database (MySQL - Master-Slave Cluster):**
   - Role: Stores and manages application data.
   - **Why**: Centralized data storage, supports structured queries, and provides fault tolerance through clustering.

4. **Load Balancers (HAProxy - Clustered):**
   - Role: Distributes incoming traffic among web servers.
   - **Why**: Improves availability and scalability. Clustering ensures redundancy and high availability. Distributing the load across multiple load balancers enhances reliability.

5. **Firewalls:**
   - Role: Control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
   - **Why**: Adds an extra layer of security, prevents unauthorized access.

6. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Role: Encrypts data transmitted between users and the web servers.
   - **Why**: Ensures secure communication and protects user data.

7. **Monitoring Clients (Sumologic or other services):**
   - Role: Collects and sends performance data to monitoring services.
   - **Why**: Provides insights into system health, identifies issues proactively.

8. **Additional Server:**
   - Role: Dedicated server for additional components or services.
   - **Why**: Allows flexibility for future expansions, additional services, or experiments without impacting existing infrastructure.

### Explanation of Specifics:

- **Clustered Load Balancers (HAProxy):**
  - Ensures high availability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple load balancers.
  - Offers redundancy, minimizing the risk of a single point of failure.

- **Additional Server:**
  - Provides flexibility for scaling or adding new services.
  - Ensures the separation of concerns by dedicating a server for specific functions.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

- **Uniform Components Across Servers:**
  - Issue: Uniformity can lead to a single point of failure.
  - Mitigation: Introduce diversity in server components and distribute services across different availability zones or regions.

This updated design enhances the infrastructure's scalability, availability, and flexibility by introducing clustering for load balancing and dedicating a server for additional services or future expansion.
