Server:

A physical or virtual machine running Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).
Domain Name:

A domain name (e.g., foobar.com) is a human-readable address that points to the server's IP address.
The www subdomain (www.foobar.com) is commonly used to denote the web server.
DNS Record:

A DNS (Domain Name System) record is configured for www.foobar.com to point to the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
The www DNS record is of type 'A' (Address record) and resolves the domain to an IPv4 address.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx is installed on the server and acts as a web server.
It handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content.
Application Server:

The application server, such as PHP-FPM, is installed to execute dynamic content.
It handles requests for dynamic pages, processes PHP code, and communicates with the web server.
Application Files (Code Base):

The website's codebase (HTML, PHP, etc.) is stored on the server.
This includes the logic, functionality, and presentation of the website.
Database (MySQL):

MySQL is installed as the database management system.
It stores and manages the website's data, such as user accounts, posts, etc.
Explanation:

What is a Server?

A server is a computer or system that provides services to other computers or clients over a network.
Role of the Domain Name:

A domain name is a human-readable label that maps to an IP address. It makes it easier for users to access websites without remembering numeric IP addresses.
Type of DNS Record 'www' in www.foobar.com:

The 'www' DNS record is of type 'A' (Address record), pointing to the server's IP address.
Role of the Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Role of the Application Server:

The application server executes dynamic content (e.g., PHP code) and communicates with the web server to generate dynamic pages.
Role of the Database (MySQL):

The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, providing a backend for the application server.
Communication with the User's Computer:

Communication with the user's computer is done over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. The web server responds to user requests, serving static content and forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, making it vulnerable to failures. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime during Maintenance:

Deploying new code or performing maintenance may require restarting the web server, leading to downtime during the process.
Scalability Issues:

As the website grows and traffic increases, a single server may not handle the load efficiently. Scaling the infrastructure horizontally becomes challenging.
